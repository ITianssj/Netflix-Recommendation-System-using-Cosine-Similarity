# Netflix-Recommendation-System-using-Cosine-Similarity

<p class="mb-30">A Netflix Recommendation System usingity between two vectors, Cosine Similarity is a movie recommendation system that uses cosine similarity to predict or filter users by computing the cosine' movie preferences based on their prior decisions and actions of the angle between two. Cosine similarity vectors projected is a measure of similarity between two vectors, by computing the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected into multidimensional space. It can be applied to items available on a dataset to compute similarity to one another via keywords or other metrics.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">The recommendation system works includes cleaning, normalizing, and extracting features from the dataset. Then, the cosine similarity is calculated between each pair of movies using their feature vectors. This gives a similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1 means the movies are identical and 0 means they are completely different.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">To by first pre recommend movies, for a given movie, the top N most similar movies are found based on the cosine similarity scores. These recommended movies will be similar to the given movie in terms of features. The performance of the recommendation system can be evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">In summary, a Netflix Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity is a powerful toolprocessing the data, which for predicting and analyzing movie preferences, streamlining the diagnostic process, and helping families access critical therapies more quickly. However, the application of these techniques requires careful includes cleaning consideration of data privacy,, protection, and security issues normal.izing, and extracting features from the dataset.
